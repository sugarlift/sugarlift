### In this extraordinary body of work, Hershberg deftly negotiates the interplay between observation and invention.

His paintings are rooted in the tangible yet transcend empiric reality, pursuing the unique demands of the picture itself. Through a masterful engagement with composition, form, and narrative restraint, Hershberg reveals his deep understanding of painting as an autonomous art of fiction.

The ambitious Nudes in Abu Tor exemplifies Hershberg's meticulous pictorial thinking. The structural precision of the architecture—arches, tables, and chairs—grounds the composition in a geometric framework reminiscent of Sienese altarpieces by Sassetta. This solidity contrasts with the fluid, sensuous forms of the figures, evoking echoes of Ingres' Turkish Bathers.

In his portraiture, Hershberg pares down this complexity to explore spatial relationships and expressive contours. These works, though simple in appearance, are compositionally daring. In many, the interplay of light and shadow emphasizes the figure's contours, with the silhouette of a black armchair heightening the figure's lines and gestures.

Sugarlift is honored to present All Thought Becomes an Image, the first New York solo exhibition by Israeli artist Yedidya Hershberg, on view from June 23 through August 27, 2022, at 507 West 27th Street, New York, NY.
