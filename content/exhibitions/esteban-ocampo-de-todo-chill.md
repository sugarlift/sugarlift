### Born in Manizales, Colombia, Ocampo-Giraldo paints from memory, creating vibrant works that balance whimsy and emotional depth.

His compositions are drawn not from single moments but from a tapestry of recollections, weaving together fragments of experience to capture the inherent imperfection of memory. Exaggerated and simplified, his scenes resonate with a magical realism that feels both deeply personal and universally relatable.

In DE TODO & CHILL, Ocampo-Giraldo's playful yet poignant style takes center stage. A reflection on a pair of sunglasses, the shadow cast by a pool float, or the intimacy of a private moment between loversâ€”all are transformed into lasting, almost mythical visions through the artist's hand. His palette, rich in saturated hues, and his ability to infuse ordinary objects with an almost dreamlike significance, evoke a nostalgic charm that is uniquely his own.

Ocampo-Giraldo's compositions are infused with the spirit of magical realism, a hallmark of Colombian cultural expression. Yet, his work transcends any single cultural framework, inviting audiences to connect with the universal human experiences of love, solitude, and fleeting joy.

Sugarlift is thrilled to present DE TODO & CHILL, a solo exhibition of new paintings by Colombian artist Esteban Ocampo-Giraldo, on view from September 8 through October 22, 2022, at 507 West 27th Street, New York, NY.
