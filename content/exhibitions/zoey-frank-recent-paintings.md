### Zoey Frank's work masterfully bridges the gap between tradition and innovation, presenting paintings that defy easy classification.

Rooted in a deep knowledge of art history, Frank's pieces engage with the techniques of the Old Masters while simultaneously embracing modernist experimentation and abstraction. Her richly layered surfaces invite prolonged engagement, rewarding viewers with unexpected revelations and challenging conventional ideas of narrative and perspective.

The monumental diptych Porch Musicians (74 x 132 inches) serves as the centerpiece of the exhibition, exemplifying Frank's dynamic storytelling ability. At first glance, the painting's two panels appear cohesive, but closer inspection reveals subtle shifts: figures, objects, and even perspective transform between the left and right sides. A violinist and children emerge on one panel, while a serene blue sky dominates the other, subtly altering the mood and level of abstraction.

This interplay between abstraction and figuration also defines Frank's Breakfast Table series, a trio of paintings that explores the passage of time and the emotional resonance of ordinary moments. Each piece captures a scene at the same table, rendered through a reduced palette that shifts with the narrative: green with orange highlights as a couple sits down to breakfast, pink with green as they read together, and orange with blue as a woman sits alone.

Sugarlift is proud to present Zoey Frank: Recent Paintings, the artist's second solo exhibition with the gallery, on view from October 27, 2022, through January 7, 2023, at 507 West 27th Street, New York, NY.
