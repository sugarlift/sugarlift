### Each painting in The Big Ruckus exudes vitality, its layers of sweeping, expressionist brushstrokes humming with energy and dynamism.

Jefferson's unique process revolves around his signature tool, the "BIG BRUSH," a custom-made device combining two 8-inch brushes. This instrument enables Jefferson to distill his process into essential, immediate gestures, creating compositions that are both raw and refined. The deliberate yet fluid movements leave behind an intricate interplay of overlapping color and form, inviting viewers to immerse themselves in the drama and depth of each canvas.

"This new body of work continues my exploration of essential brushwork and layered abstraction," Jefferson shares. "By limiting my palette and focusing on intentional gestures, I've developed a process that reveals the soft underbelly of intention. These paintings are the culmination of years in the studio, and I hope they express the emotional knowledge I've gained through their creation."

Raised in California, Jefferson draws inspiration from his roots in skateboarding and surf culture, as well as an eclectic range of artistic influencesâ€”from the vibrancy of Barry McGee's West Coast street art to the emotional resonance of painters like Edvard Munch and Cecily Brown. His work bridges figuration and abstraction, combining fluid, wave-like strokes with optical effects that create a vivid, almost kinetic presence on the canvas.

Sugarlift is delighted to present Josh Jefferson: The Big Ruckus, a solo exhibition featuring new paintings by Josh Jefferson, on view from March 30 through May 6, 2023, at 507 West 27th Street, New York, NY.
