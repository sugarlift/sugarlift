### Vietnamese-American artist Kenny Nguyen embarks on a personal journey through his new exhibition Chạm: Mapping Identity.

Nguyen recently returned to Vietnam for the first time since moving to the United States over a decade ago. He became acutely aware of the changes that had unfolded in his absence – the rapid pace of globalization, development, and corresponding cultural shifts had left an indelible mark on the societal fabric of his homeland. Nguyen's new body of work seeks to capture the nuanced challenges he encountered while reclaiming his transformed cultural roots.

In Chạm: Mapping Identity, Nguyen navigates the complexities of diaspora and belonging, using art as a means to bridge the temporal and cultural divide between his past and present. The Vietnamese word "chạm," meaning "touch," "engrave," and "encounter," serves as both a thematic anchor and a guiding principle for the exhibition. These meanings converge to explore the tangible and intangible forces that shape identity—memory, transformation, and connection.

Nguyen's work merges traditional and contemporary elements, evoking the rapid globalization and cultural shifts he witnessed in his homeland. Each piece is imbued with textures that feel etched by time: layered pigments, embossed motifs, and imprints that echo Vietnam's evolving landscape and its enduring cultural essence. Paintings, mixed media works, and installations invite viewers to experience the delicate balance of continuity and change.

Through this exhibition, Nguyen reflects on the transformative power of re-engagement—how encountering the unfamiliar in the familiar can forge a deeper, more resilient understanding of oneself and one's heritage. As Nguyen explains, "Through embracing change, we can forge a deeper connection with our roots and ultimately find a renewed sense of self in an ever-changing world."

Sugarlift is pleased to present Kenny Nguyen: Chạm: Mapping Identity, a solo exhibition on view from December 1, 2023, through January 31, 2024, at 507 West 27th Street, New York, NY.
