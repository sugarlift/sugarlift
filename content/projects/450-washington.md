### Situated along the Hudson River in Tribeca, 450 Washington is a modern waterfront residence designed to support a 24/7 lifestyle with thoughtfully curated amenities.

Interiors by March and White Design bring warmth and functionality to communal and private spaces, including a golf simulator, co-working areas, and an expansive rooftop deck.

For this project, our art consulting team drew from Tribeca’s cultural heritage and contemporary energy, commissioning works through local galleries and seamlessly integrating them throughout the building. Each piece reflects design history, cultural context, and a forward-thinking ethos informed by modern hospitality, bridging heritage with innovation to enrich residents’ experiences.
