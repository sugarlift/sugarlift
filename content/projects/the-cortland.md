### The Cortland is a new residential property in Chelsea, bridging the neighborhood's industrial heritage with a refined modern aesthetic.

Architecture by Robert A.M. Stern Architects and interiors by Olson Kundig combine materials, fluid layouts, and subtle nods to local artistry. This synergy fosters a welcoming environment where heritage and innovation coalesce.

Our art consulting approach curates pieces that soften The Cortland's materials while reflecting its urban context. Installations and contemporary artworks highlight Chelsea's creative lineage, adding dimension throughout amenity spaces and lounges. Each selection merges elegance and functionality, inviting residents into a curated world where design history meets forward-thinking style.
