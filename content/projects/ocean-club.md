### Set along the Bahamian coastline, the Ocean Club, a Four Seasons Resort, weaves grand architectural elements with its secluded enclave layout and storied Versailles-style gardens.

This refined retreat honors its heritage while embracing modern hospitality, inviting guests into an environment where historical charm and contemporary design naturally coexist.

Sugarlift curated a purposeful art program celebrating local Bahamian flora and fauna through limited-edition prints, each capturing the island's vibrant natural character. Collaborating with several artists, the team produced artworks that reinforce the property's sense of place, seamlessly complementing the newly renovated guest rooms with an authentic cultural connection.
