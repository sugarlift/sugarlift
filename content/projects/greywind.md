### Greywind is a seasonally driven restaurant in Hudson Yards. Interiors by Parts and Labor Design blend the rustic charm of the Hudson Valley with Manhattan's urban edge.

This carefully calibrated space supports modern hospitality demands, balancing warm wood tones with industrial accents for a welcoming yet contemporary dining experience.

Sugarlift's art program complements this vision, presenting works by contemporary artists that honor design heritage while embracing fresh perspectives. Each piece was selected to mirror Greywind's emphasis on nature and seasonality, inviting patrons into an immersive narrative. By gracefully integrating art and cuisine, Greywind showcases how heritage and innovation seamlessly converge.
