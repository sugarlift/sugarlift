### 50 Hudson Yards is a commercial property designed by Foster + Partners that reimagines the modern workplace with scale and sophistication.

Interiors blend New York's understated classic aesthetic with a forward-looking approach to function and form. The result is a refined environment where heritage and innovation coexist.

An expertly curated art program complements these spaces with bold, site-responsive pieces, including custom commissions by Kenny Nguyen. Each work is chosen to honor the building's architectural lineage while animating a contemporary aesthetic. Together, they create a cohesive, engaging experience that balances history and progress, inviting exploration.
