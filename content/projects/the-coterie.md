### Coterie Hudson Yards redefines luxury senior living by combining sophisticated design and practical amenities within Manhattan’s most dynamic neighborhood.

Developed by Related Companies and Atria Senior Living, the Handel Architects–designed residence features an interior concept by March and White that balances classic finishes with modern functionality. Residents enjoy curated experiences, including restaurants, a bakery, a private gym, and a salon, all complemented by 24/7 care and services.

The art program accentuates this lively setting, showcasing selected, contemporary works that echo Hudson Yards’ cultural energy. Each piece underscores a respect for both design legacy and innovation, blending heritage with forward-thinking artistry."
