### "At 1901 North Flagler Drive, Shorecrest emerges as a new venture by The Related Companies, integrating with West Palm Beach’s evolving skyline.

Conceived by Roger Ferris & Partners, this 26-story tower overlooks the Intracoastal Waterway, uniting local heritage with modern living.

Sugarlift curated an art collection for the sales office, aligning each piece with Shorecrest’s future-focused narrative. Thoughtful commissions highlight West Palm Beach’s culture, acknowledging its modern energy and heritage. Through strategic selection, the artwork underscores Shorecrest’s commitment to an elevated, rooted residential experience. This synergy enhances every client interaction."
