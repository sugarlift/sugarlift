### 60 Columbus Circle stands as an iconic Midtown Manhattan landmark, revitalized by Related Companies to marry modern functionality with timeless aesthetics.

With Skidmore, Owings & Merrill's architectural expertise, the property exudes refined simplicity that caters to contemporary business needs while preserving its notable prestige. Its newly transformed lobby offers a welcoming atmosphere.

To enrich this setting, our art consulting team commissioned a vibrant triptych by Zhu Jinshi, installed to contrast the lobby's subtle palette and highlight the building's cultural significance. Through careful curation, international shipping, and white-glove installation, we achieved a truly seamless union of art, architecture, and modern hospitality.
